# AdminLoginPortal
Creating template for admin login + dashboard for all hackathons I attend

<p>To run:
Please delete the following directory: instance and pycache --> RUN setup_db.py --> RUN login.html
</p>
<p>P.S: Never trusting people with setting up databases. Someone took 8 hours to setup one! Yea, I am dumping emos on git</p>
